This is my first try to publish something wiht github pages.

The List of [plugins](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll#plugins) looks interesting.

With [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) I use markdown for content and with literate-coffeescript I could use it for writing code as well.
Would be interesting if one could include literatecoffeescript as a post as well. Someday...
